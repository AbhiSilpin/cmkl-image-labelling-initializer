Image Labelling Setup:
    
✅ for every video file in the directory
    - create a folder with corresponding name
    - move the video inside the folder
✅ for each folder: 
    - move inside the folder
    - create labels, raw_frames, and selected_imgs folder
    - use ffmpeg command to split the video into raw_frames
    - move all .jpg files into raw_frames
    - move back out
    
    ❗ make the command support different file types
    ❗ consider a different command for finding the video file name
    ❓ prompt user for the path and file type input

Next Steps:
    👉 Automate the download (random?) from cloud drive + unzipping
    👉 Populate the .xml file with corresponding selected_imgs names when the first static image is annotated
